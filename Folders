Lib contains your drt files, can create a few in this folder and merge later
but it's good to keep seperate until later so it's more readable.
File needs to end in .dart so the code editor knows how to read it

Folders that contain platform name nmes simply contain platform specific files
Typiucally you dont need to do nything with them, flutter will chnge and update as needed,
they are managed by flutter. They become important when you're ready to publish the app
to the specific platform

Build folder is important but you won't work within it, managed automtically by flutter

test folder conatins dart files, you can write code that tests your main code to catch errors early

folders containining a dot simply hold extra configurations
